PEP 517 specifies a standard API for systems which build Python packages.

This package contains wrappers around the hooks specified by PEP 517. It provides:

    A mechanism to call the hooks in a subprocess, so they are isolated from the current process.
    Fallbacks for the optional hooks, so that frontends can call the hooks without checking which are defined.
    Higher-level functions which install the build dependencies into a temporary environment and build a wheel/sdist using them.
