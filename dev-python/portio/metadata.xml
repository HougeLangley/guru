	<longdescription>PortIO is a Python wrapper for the port I/O macros like outb, inb, etc. provided by the C library on Linux x86 platforms. Both python 2 and 3 are supported. This module is useful when a general pourpose port I/O at the low level is needed. Programmers that want to perform I/O on the parallel port at an higher level, will be better satisfied by the pyParallel module. A similar module Ioport has inspired the writing of PortIO.</longdescription>
