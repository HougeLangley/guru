    remail is a very simplistic mailing list tool which provides encryption.

    remail reads mail from a maildir, decrypts it with the mailing list private
    key and re-encrypts it for every enabled subscriber. The resulting mails are
    delivered to the localhost's SMTP server.

    remail supports S/MIME and PGP on both ends.
