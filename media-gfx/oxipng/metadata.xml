Overview

Oxipng is a multithreaded lossless PNG compression optimizer. It can be used via a command-line interface or as a library in other Rust programs.
History

Oxipng began as a complete rewrite of the OptiPNG project, which was assumed to be dead as no commit had been made to it since March 2014. (OptiPNG has since released a new version, after Oxipng was first released.) The name has been changed to avoid confusion and potential legal issues.

The core goal of rewriting OptiPNG was to implement multithreading, which would be very difficult to do within the existing C codebase of OptiPNG. This also served as an opportunity to choose a more modern, safer language (Rust).
