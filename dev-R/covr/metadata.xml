		Test Coverage for Packages // Track and report code coverage for
		your package and (optionally) upload the results to a coverage
		service like 'Codecov' https://codecov.io or 'Coveralls'
		https://coveralls.io. Code coverage is a measure of the amount
		of code being exercised by a set of tests. It is an indirect
		measure of test quality and completeness. This package is
		compatible with any testing methodology or framework and tracks
		coverage of both R code and compiled C/C++/FORTRAN code.
