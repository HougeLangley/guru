	Cawbird is a fork of the Corebird Twitter client from Baedert, which became unsupported after Twitter disabled the streaming API.

	Cawbird works with the new APIs and includes a few fixes and modifications that have historically been patched in to IBBoard's custom Corebird build on his personal Open Build Service account.
