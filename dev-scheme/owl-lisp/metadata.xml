        Owl Lisp is a simple programming language. The main motivation for
        writing it was to get a portable system for writing standalone
        programs in a subjectively pleasant dialect of LISP, which in this
        case means a minimal core language and runtime, purely functional
        operation and support for asynchronous evaluation.
